# TraningGermanWords
A small Application for learning German verbs.<p>
'main' can be found in scr/main/java/App/RunApp
## How it works?

Each verb has its own card, which contains 4 forms of this verb:
* infinitiv (sein)
* 3 form (ist)
* pr√§teritum (war)
* partizip 2 (gewesen)
 
### Play
During the game, the player is shown one of the forms of the verb, and the player must write all the others. If he makes a mistake in at least one field, the attempt is marked as unsuccessful.

### Choosing cards 
All cards (verbs ) are grouped by type of declension and by the first letter. Before a play, a player can choose the desired type, as well as the order of issuing cards and the showing form of the verb.

### Statistic
At the end of the game, the user will be prompted to save to a file all the verbs that were written correctly and incorrectly. The player can continue to train, but in this time with verbs, where he made a mistake.

### Loading other verbs
Saved files with verbs can also be used if the user wants to practice only with these verbs again.
